# Titanic-project
This project is a part of my University course of Computational Social Science which aims to explore significant social phenomena.

The idea of the analysis is to represent correlation between chances to survive on Titanic ship and another properties such as sex, age of passangers and etc. All the rults are presented in graphical and numerical views.

# Source
In creating this project I used basic python libraries and algorithms implemented with the help of Jupyter Notebook software.
